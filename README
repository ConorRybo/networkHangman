Outline:

- Hangman game with 4 max players (for now). All the players are playing against the computer which picks from a small list of words.
    - Turn based, random number is chosen (0-3) to see which client will start
    - 6 guesses total - head, body, l arm, r arm, l leg, r leg (order of when they appear)
    - word to be guessed resides on server the whole time, server will send messages to the clients based on what is going on
    - user interface is then built on the clients based on these messages

Messages:

-- When there are 4 players connected to the server, the game is started. 
   
    -- S# -> sent from server to all of the clients;
        \# - number of blanks in word players are guessing
        B - "begin"
   
    -- G -> character sent to the client whose turn it is to guessing
        - flush stdin to avoid collecting button spam junk for whole game
        - only takes first character that player types (ignore rest if multiple)
        - when the G is recieved client should prompt user to enter character
        - waitg (blocking) for the user to enter a character
        - FORCE EVERYTHING TO LOWERCASE
   
    -- Gα -> client (whose turn it was) response to the server
        G - represents "guess"
        α - the guessed character (forced to lowercase by the client)

    -- Cα#{,#} -> servers response based on a CORRECT guess from a client
        C - represents "correct"
        α - the guessed letter
        \#{,#} - the number(s) represent the positions on the blanks where α need to be filled in

    -- Iα -> servers response to an INCORRECT response from the clients
        I - respresents an "incorrect" guess from client  
        α - the incorrectly guessed letter to be added to the "guessed" tab
